        Hello , I am Kyle Prestado, creator of this Blackjack website. It's a project for the Web Dev Lite of Uplift
        Code Camp where we were tasked to create a game using Javascript. I thought of Blackjack as one of the few games
        that I can create in Javascript since the card game was simple enough to understand and feasible enough to code.

       </p>

       <p>

        It's my first time using Javascript so this project was a lot of challenge since it requires a lot of
        Javascript fundamentals but I was able to learn those as I code and know what I need to make the program work. 
        I first understand how import HTML IDs and classes into javascript and learned how function works to be able to
        implement it in click events. I also learned how to append an image into a string to be able to have a card image
        shown when a certain string is called and creating an array to have a random deck of cards. 

       </p>

       <p>

        There were of course a lot of errors and revisions while creating the program. I initially thought of creating an
        array for the sum of the player cards but the addition assignment was already enough and it was the cause of an error
        where the sum is doubled. I have errors as well in creating the random deck where some card values would repeat itself
        in the deck so I fix it with the fisher-yates algorithm.
        
       </p>

       <p>

        Overall, I was satisfied with what I was able to create during this project and the skills I was able to learn from it.
        I still struggle with some concepts but with more projects and activities, I can grasp it better.
        There is still lot to learn in Javascript but I feel like I'm at a level where I can now start learning more advanced concepts.
