        <p>
        Blackjack is a card game where players aim to have a higher sum of cards than the dealer but 
        not exceeding 21.
        </p>

        <p> 
        Ace can have a value of 1 or 11, face cards are counted as 10, and numbered cards have its value as is .
        (Ex. A Jack of Clubs is a 10 while a Seven of Hearts is counted as 7).
        </p>

        <p>
        A player initially has two face-up cards while the dealer has a face-up and a face-down card.
        </p>

        <p>
        A player can Hit as much as they want which draws a card from the deck and Stand
        which retains the player's current card. The dealer are forced to hit once if their sum is 16 and stand if their
        sum is 17.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The dealer reveals the face-down card once the player stands or is busted(sum over 21).
        </p>

        <p>
        The player also wins once the dealer goes bust.
        </p>
